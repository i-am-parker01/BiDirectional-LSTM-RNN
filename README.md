# BiDirectional-LSTM-RNN
A BiDirectional LSTM RNN that can analyzes the sentiment about any movie based on IMdb dataset.
# ðŸŽ¬ Sentiment Analysis with Bi-Directional LSTM RNN

This project implements a Bi-Directional RNN with LSTM layers** to perform sentiment analysis on text reviews.  
The trained model is served using FastAPI, allowing predictions via a simple REST API.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Bi-Directional LSTM architecture for sequence classification
- Trained on the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**
- FastAPI backend for easy deployment
- REST API endpoints for sentiment prediction
- Interactive Swagger UI (`/docs`) to test the API
